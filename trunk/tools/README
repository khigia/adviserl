Thanks to CK for those scripts!
(when not working with git it really do help a lot)

Instructions for using the svnmerge, svn-branch2trunk, svn-branch2trunk-diff, svn-trunk2branch, svn-trunk2-branch-diff, svn-create-branch tools.

== EXAMPLE

1. Create a branch (R1). 
2. Make changes to trunk.
3. Update R1 with changes from trunk.
4. Make changes to R1
5. Update trunk with changes from R1.

= 1. CREATE BRANCH
    demouser@demohost:~/svn/repos1/trunk$ svn-create-branch ../branches/R1
    CREATE branch:
     /home/demouser/svn/repos1/trunk/../branches/R1
    FROM trunk:

    demouser@demohost:~/svn/repos1/branches/R1$ svn-trunk2branch
    MERGE trunk CHANGES:
     ../../trunk

    demouser@demohost:~/svn/repos1/branches/R1$ cat >> README
    
    branch changes can go back to TRUNK as well
    demouser@demohost:~/svn/repos1/branches/R1$ svn commit -m 'changes from R1'
    Sending        R1/README
    Transmitting file data .
    Committed revision 41.

    demouser@demohost:~/svn/repos1/trunk$ svn-branch2trunk ../branches/R1
    MERGE branch CHANGES:

== NOTES

svn-create-branch and svn-branch2trunk can only be run in a trunk directory.

svn-trunk2branch can only be run outside of trunk directory 
    (defaults to ../../trunk as the path to trunk)
